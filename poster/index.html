                <strong>Abstract</strong><br />
                Many exoplanets have been discovered in binary star systems, on internal (S-type) or circumbinary (P-type) orbits. In this study, we considered the problem of stability for planets of finite (non negligible) mass using a high precision integration algorithm. We approached the problem by selecting a huge set of initial conditions for planetary orbits of the S-type, to perform very extended in time integrations at varying: the planet mass, its distance from the primary star, the mass ratio for the two stars in the system, and the eccentricity of the initial star motion. For our numerical integrations, we resorted to the use of a 15th order integration scheme (IAS15, available within the 
                <a href="https://rebound.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank"

                framework), that provides an optimal solution for long-term time integrations. We estimated the probability of different types of instability: planet collisions with the primary or secondary star or planet ejected away from the binary star system. We confirm and generalize to massive planets the dependence of the critical semi-major axis on eccentricity and mass ratio of the binary as already found by

Another, natural, extension of our previous work has been the study of perturbations induced to circumbinary planet motion by a passing-by star, like it often happens in a star cluster. We performed a series of more than 4500 scattering experiments with different initial conditions typical of encounters in small star clusters. We found some interesting behaviors of the systems after perturbation and showed how a transition from an inner (S-type) stable orbit to a circumbinary (P-type) (and vice-versa) has a low, but non negligible,  probability.

                    <li>the stability of S-type orbits of planets with a negligible mass as well as with a mass of the order of one or 30 Jupiter mass;</li>
                    <li>the consequences of a star scattering with the planetary system, with different initial conditions typical of encounters in small star clusters.</li>

              <p>
                An example of stable planetary orbit is shown in Fig. 2. As a demostration, we also created a prototype of a <a href="https://giovixo.github.io/exoplanets/index.html" target="_blank">real time orbit simulator</a>. 
                To cover a large set of different configurations, we made long term numerical integrations of a large number (more than ten thousand) of planetary orbits, using the high precision 15th order integration scheme <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446.

                target="_blank">REBOUND</a> framework. The stability of the orbits depends mainly on the initial distance of the planet from the primary star, on the mass ratio of the two stars, and on the eccentricity of the binary star system. In this study, we assume that the motion of the planet is co-planar with the star motion; we also set to zero the initial eccentricity of the planet motion.

              <p>
                We classify the planetary orbits on the basis of their stability, considering an orbit unstable if (i) the planet will collide in a finite time with one of the two stars or (ii) it is ejected from the binary system. For all the unstable orbit, we also get the <em>survival time</em>, i.e. the time needed for the collision or the escape to occur. For stable orbits, we estimate the mean deviation &Delta; r of the actual planet orbit from the unperturbed (by the secondary star) one.

                The Fig 3 shows an orbit with a collision with the secondary star, Fig. 4 an ejection away from the binary. In last case, we notice that, before escaping, the planet moves in an outer orbit. This leads to the hypothesis that, under certain conditions, a transition from an internal (S-type) orbit to an external (P-type) orbit may occur.

                The distribution of collisions, ejections, and stable orbits is reported in Fig. 5, for a binary star with e = 0.5 and mass ratio &mu; = 0.5. In this particular configuration, we find that the statistics of collisions and ejections does not depend on the planetary mass.

                The results presented in the previous panel assume that the planetary system is isolated. However, for binary system systems living in star clusters, the effect of scattering with a passing-by star must be taken into account. To attack this problem, we performed a large number (more than 4500) of scattering experiments with different initial conditions typical of encounters in small star clusters.

              <h3>Conclusions</h3>
              <p>
                The problem of stability in binary star systems is a longstanding topic. In our work we have made several progresses compared to previous works. In particular:
                <ul>
                  <li>we apply a high precision numerical integrator, also considering planets of not negligible mass,</li>
                  <li>we evaluate the statistics of the various types of instability, the ejections of the planets and the collisions with the primary or secondary star,</li>
                  <li>we study the effect of external perturbations due to a passing by star in a star cluster.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                In the future, we will go in different directions. The applications of High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques will allow a significant extension of the space of parameters. In particular, we will investigate the dependence of stability on the inclination of the orbital plane of the planet and on its initial eccentricity. Data analysis may be challenging in the case of very large dataset; a promising way to get results for data is based on Machine Learning techniques (see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...832L..22T/abstract" target="_blank" >Tamayo et al (2016)</a>)
