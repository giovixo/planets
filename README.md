# planets
Simulation of a planetary motion in a binary star system. Have a look at the [demo page](https://giovixo.github.io/planets/).

This project uses the [fourth-order Runge Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) for gravity simulation in Javascript developed by [jbochi](https://github.com/jbochi/planets). On the [demo](http://jbochi.github.io/planets/) page, [recently found three-body orbits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0181) can be seen.
